   			<p> My name is Michael Wang, and I'm currently a freshman studying <em><strong> computer science</strong></em> at UC Berkeley. Though I never had any real exposure to the tech field prior to college (I had a knack for biology and all things enzymes ending in "-ase"), I began to develop a passion for building programs and webpages through our school's CS introductory class, <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/fa14/">CS10 </a>, which I am excited to lab assist for in Spring 2015!</p>

   			<p> This semester, I'm looking forward to learning more about object-oriented programming involving python and scheme. My goal is to get more experience not only with back-end coding, but also with front-end design using Bootstrap and possibly Jekyll, too!</p>
   			<p> I'll be uploading my projects onto my <a href="https://github.com/mikomwang">Github! </a> Stay tuned!</p>

   			<h1> Interests </h1>
   			<p> When I'm not in front of the computer learning code <strike>and gradually obtaining the skills necessary to rule the world </strike>, you could probably find me on the tennis courts. In fact, I've played varsity tennis for my highschool tennis team and am planning on joining intramural tennis at UC Berkeley! <sub><sub>Fun fact: I usually play tennis in a pair of black shorts... but I forgot it <a href="tennis pic.jpg">on picture day. </a> </sub></sub> </p>

   			<p> One of the people that continually inspire me is Donald Glover AKA Childish Gambino. Actor, Screen Writer, Rapper (Double-entendre extraordinaire!), Comedian, Code-enthusiast, Innovator, and self-proclaimed nerdy boy- Donald's work ethic and humble attitude are two important qualities I strive to achieve. </p>

   			<p> When I was younger, I played a lot of piano. Though I do not play as often nor as well anymore, I still really enjoy learning and playing piano covers of modern pop songs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCdwKhTtNNw"> Here's what I'm trying to learn right now </a>
   			</p>

   			<p> If you haven't noticed the navigation bar already, I'm trying to get into <a href= "Photography.html"> photography </a>. Well, I mean, I'm a complete novice but let's just pretend that me slapping some filters onto pictures that I took with my iPhone is considered photography.
